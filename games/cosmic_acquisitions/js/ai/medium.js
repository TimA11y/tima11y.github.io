// Medium-tier AI: one-ply heuristic scoring, per docs/ai-design.md. Same
// decision-only contract as js/ai/easy.js (a getViewFor() view in, a plain
// choice out — never mutates state itself, per docs/data-model.md's
// privacy rule applied symmetrically to AI), and the same tier-agnostic
// function shapes dispatched by js/ai/index.js's getAiStrategy(). The exact
// weights below are the "empirical tuning" docs/ai-design.md explicitly
// left open for implementation time — chosen to be directionally right
// (grow > isolated, founding is strong, consolidate existing positions)
// rather than precisely tuned against real play data.
//
// Every scoring function here only weighs the acting AI's OWN shares —
// docs/ai-design.md's "avoid mergers that mainly benefit the human" is
// approximated as "favor moves that build my own position" rather than
// actually inspecting what the human holds. Note this is a scope choice for
// this tier, not an information-hiding constraint: opponents' shares/credits
// are legitimately public (see docs/data-model.md, revised 2026-09-06 while
// building the hard tier) and visible in the view this function receives —
// medium just doesn't look, since a real relative-holdings comparison would
// be more lookahead/complexity than a one-ply heuristic is meant to have.
